                    facility, banking and health-care services, and a cafeteria.
                    In spite of being located in the thriving part of the city, Ram Krishan College campus is extremely
                    verdurous. It has a maze of tall trees, lush green lawns and pruned hedges. A herbal garden within the
                    premises is a source of pride for the college. Apart from the academic and administrative sections of
                    the college, the campus located in 39 acres of land includes a sports ground, a residential complex for
                    the staff and two pond for water harvesting.

                    Ram Krishan College believes in and promotes the ideals of gender equality and community service. To
                    this effect the college offers some relaxation in cut-offs to female students during the time of
                    admissions. The college also honours and celebrates men and women working towards women's empowerment.

                    We take pride in making the college campus a green zone. We have numerous environment friendly practices
                    in place on the campus: 'ban on plastic', 'ban on smoking,' 'no vehicle entry', and tree plantation are
                    some of the measures implemented to reduce the carbon prints on campus. We limit the use of
                    non-renewable resources and rely on alternative sources like solar panels, water-harvesting pits, and
                    paper-recycling unit. <b> Ram Krishna College </b>  also ensures proper waste disposal, be it organic waste,
                    e-waste, or sanitary waste. While organic-waste is transformed into vermi-compost, e-waste is
                    identified, labelled, and disposed of depending on the nature of the substance. Taking note of the
                    importance of sanitary hygiene and effective waste disposal, <b> Ram Krishna College </b>  also took the
                    initiative of installing sanitary waste incinerator in women's washrooms in the college. Ram Krishan
                    College has come a long way from its humble beginnings and moderate facilities to a campus equipped with
                    impressive amenities.
