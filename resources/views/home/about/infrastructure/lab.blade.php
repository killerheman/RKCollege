                                        of AIHC &amp; Archaeology, RK College, Madhubani has a purpose-built laboratory
                                        for archaeological sciences. The under-graduate and post-graduate courses cover the
                                        prehistoric and proto-historic human past in India, Europe and Africa. The scope of
                                        our teaching is global and it covers both theory and practical in archaeology.
                                        Students gain essential hands experience from the artefacts housed in the museum of
                                        the department during their practical classes. The Museum has a large collection of
                                        Prehistoric artefacts that have been collected during archaeological field-work over
                                        a long period of time. In the second year (IIIrd semester), PG students of
                                        numismatics specialization are involve in numerous practical methods like coin
                                        making by plaster of paris etc. They also have to practice conservation and
                                        preservation of coins from rusting and patina. They learn about the chemicals used
                                        in conservation and preservation of antiquities. &nbsp;Again in the Second year
                                        (IVth semester), PG students of archaeology goes through a field training. The
                                        students along with their teachers visit the ongoing excavations site to learn the
                                        basic pattern of field archaeology. Identification of potteries, antiquities and
                                        methods of excavations and explorations are being taught to the students. After
                                        returning from the field trip, the students analyze the data and are required to
                                        prepare a field report. Pottery drawing is one of the major work conducted in our
                                        laboratory, for which we use to invite the experts of this field from other
                                        universities too. The students are also engaged in Epigraphy practical in which they
                                        learn the basics of Epigraphy. Understanding, identification and writing various
